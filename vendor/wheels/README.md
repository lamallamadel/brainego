# Offline wheels - downloaded once, committed for CI/CD no-egress policy
# Generated by: bash scripts/generate-wheelhouse.sh
# Used in CI: pip install --no-index --find-links=vendor/wheels -r requirements-test.txt

This directory contains pre-downloaded Python wheels for testing dependencies.
All wheels are vendoried here to enable offline installation in CI/CD environments
with strict egress policies (no external pip downloads allowed).

## How to regenerate

On a machine with Internet access and Python 3.11:

```bash
bash scripts/generate-wheelhouse.sh
```

Then commit vendor/wheels/ to the repository.

## Why this approach?

✅ Zero network access in CI/CD
✅ Reproducible builds
✅ No proxy/egress policy violations
✅ Fast pip install (local filesystem only)
✅ Works in offline environments
