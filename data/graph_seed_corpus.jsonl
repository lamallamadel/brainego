{"document_id":"doc-afr42-001","metadata":{"title":"MVP RAG reliability sprint"},"text":"Alice worked on the Retrieval Stability Project with Bob. The team faced hallucination problems caused by weak chunking. Charlie solved the issue by introducing semantic chunking and confidence scoring. The lesson from the sprint is that small chunk overlap improves grounding quality."}
{"document_id":"doc-afr42-002","metadata":{"title":"Knowledge graph indexing"},"text":"Diana designed the Graph Index Refresh initiative. The project connects Neo4j entities to RAG passages. A latency spike problem was caused by repeated embedding calls and was fixed by Evan using batch embeddings. The team learned from this incident that caching avoids duplicate vector work."}
{"document_id":"doc-afr42-003","metadata":{"title":"Postmortem for onboarding assistant"},"text":"Farah built the Onboarding Assistant Project. The assistant uses concept maps for architecture lessons. A context loss problem was solved by Grace with a memory summary strategy. The lesson learned from the project is that concise summaries improve answer consistency."}
